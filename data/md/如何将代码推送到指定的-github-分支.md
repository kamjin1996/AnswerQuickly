# How to Push Code to a Specific GitHub Branch

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to push your local code to a specific branch on GitHub. This includes creating a new branch, switching branches, and pushing code to the remote branch.

## 1. Clone the Remote Repository

If you haven't already cloned the remote repository to your local machine, you need to execute the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
```

Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

## 2. Check Local Branches

Before pushing your code, you may want to check the current local and remote branch lists:

```bash
git branch         # View local branches
git branch -r      # View remote branches
```

## 3. Create and Switch to a New Branch

If you need to work on a new branch, you can create and switch to it:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

Replace `new-branch` with the name of the branch you wish to create.

## 4. Commit Code to the Local Branch

After making changes on the new branch, you need to commit those changes to the local branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Replace `Your commit message` with a message describing the changes you've made.

## 5. Push Code to the Remote Branch

Push the local branch to the remote repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin new-branch
```

Here, `origin` is the default name for the remote repository, and `new-branch` is the name of the remote branch you're pushing to.

## 6. Set the Remote Branch as the Default Branch (Optional)

If you want to set the new branch as the default branch, you need to do this on GitHub. Visit your repository page, go to **Settings** -> **Branches**, and select your newly pushed branch in the **Default branch** section.

## 7. Submit a Pull Request (Optional)

If you want to merge changes into the main branch or another branch, you can submit a Pull Request. Visit your repository page, click on **Pull requests**, then **New pull request**, select the branches to compare, and create the Pull Request.

## Summary

By following the above steps, you can push your code to a specific GitHub branch and perform further operations as needed. Make sure to communicate with your team before pushing and merging to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
